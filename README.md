### Temperatures

**Topics:** *Arrays, Loops, Conditions*

#### Statement
Your program must analyze records of temperatures to find the closest to zero.

#### Story
It's freezing cold out there! Will you be able to find the temperature closest to zero in a set of temperatures readings?

#### Rules
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

### The Descent

**Topics:** *Loops*

#### Statement
A simple problem to try out the CodinGame platform: your program must find the highest mountain out of a list of mountains.

#### Story
The Enterprise ship is in danger: drawn towards the surface of an unknown planet, it is at risk of crashing against towering mountains. Help Kirk and Spock destroy the mountains... Save the Enterprise!

#### Rules
At the start of each game turn, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right. By the end of the game turn, you must fire on the highest mountain by outputting its index (from 0 to 7). Firing on a mountain will only destroy part of it, reducing its height. Your ship descends after each pass.
